Given a vector space $V$ and a subspace of $V$, $U \subseteq V$. A linear mapping $\pi : V \rightarrow U$ is called a projection if $$\pi ^{2} = \pi \circ \pi = \pi$$
This definition can be applied to the transformation matrix called **projection matrix** $\bf{P}_{\pi}$  that have the property $\bf{P}_{\pi}^{2} = \bf{P}_{\pi}$
