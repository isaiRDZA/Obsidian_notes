_"An epic is a large user story that cannot be completed in a single iteration and needs to be decomposed into smaller, manageable stories."_ The purpose of an epic is to group related work and maintain a strategic view of product development. Epics are commonly used in Agile frameworks such as [[SCRUM]] and SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) to manage complex requirements.

Epics are often part of a **hierarchical structure** in Agile, where:

1. **Themes** represent broad business objectives.
2. **Epics** break down themes into sizable deliverables.
3. **User stories** further divide epics into small, actionable tasks.
