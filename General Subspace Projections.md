Assuming that $(b_{1},...,b_{m})$ is an ordered basis of $U$. Any projection $\pi_{U}(x)$ over $U$ must be an $U$ element. Therefore, it can be represented as linear combination of the basis vectors from the base $b_{1},...,b_{m}$ from $U$, so $\pi_{U}(\bf{x}) = \sum^{m}_{i=1} \lambda_{i}\bf{b}_{i}$ 
$$\begin{align}\pi_{U}(\bf{x}) = \sum^{m}_{i=1} \lambda_{i}\bf{b}_{i}=\bf{B\lambda},\\
\bf{B} = [(b_{1},...,b_{m}]\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times m}, \ \ \lambda = [(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda _{m}]^{\top}\in \mathbb{R}^{m} \end{align} $$
