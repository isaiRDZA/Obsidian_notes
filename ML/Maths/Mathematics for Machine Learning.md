The specialization have three courses all courses in [[NumPy]]:
1. [[Linear Algebra]]: [[Vectors]], [[Matrix]], [[Linear transformation]], [[equation systems]], [[determinants]]. 
		Luis S: A matrix can be seen as an array of numbers, but also books can  be seen as an array of letters. But books can take us to a intersting stories and places on our minds. The same happens with matrices, they can be seen in a very deeper ways.
		Andrew NG: A lot of the [[neural networks]] are built on top of [[matrix operations]].
		Luis S: That's what neural networks do they're just a bunch of matrices with activations in the middle that warp space.

2. [[Calculus]]: [[Maximizing]] and [[minimazing]].
		Bast majority of [[learning algorithms]] are creating by defining a cost function and minimizing it. When you can picture the [[gradient descent]] or [[adam]] derivatives in your head you're better able to tune the algorithm.

3. [[Probability]]: Many times a model outputs a probability and probability can be used to train models. E.g. [[maximum likehood estimation]]
