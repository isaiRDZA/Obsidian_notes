There are a Number Summary for quantitative data
- Minimum: Smallest value
- 1st Quartile: Where 25 percent of the data falls bellow that value
- Median: Where 50 percent of the data falls bellow that value
- 3rd Quartile: Where 75 percent of the data falls bellow that value
- Max: Maximum value
- IQR (Inter Quartile Range): Q3 - Q2
- Mean: The sum of all the data points divided by the total number of data points
- Std Dev: The [[standard deviation]] is roughly the average distance that the values are from the mean 

What is the relationship between **[[mean]]** and **[[media]]** when the data is skewed to the right or left?

Summary statistics including the mean, minimum, and maximum of the data, can be useful to get a feel or the central tendency and dispersion of each variable.
```Python
tips_data.describe()
```
