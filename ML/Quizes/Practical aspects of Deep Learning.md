1. If you hace 20,000,000 examples, how would you split the train/dev/test set?
- [ ] 99% train. 0.5% dev. 0.5% test
- [ ] 60% train. 20% dev. 20% test
- [ ] 90% train. 5% dev. 5% test

2. The dev and test set should
- [ ] Come from the same distribution
- [ ] Have the same number of examples
- [ ] Come from different distributions
- [ ] Be identical to each other (same(x, y) pairs)

3. A model developed for a project is presenting high bias. One of the sponsors of the project offers some resources that might help reduce the bias. Which of the following additional resources has a better chance to help reduce the bias?
- [ ] Gather more data for the project
- [ ] Give access to more computational resources like GPUs
- [ ] Use different sources to gather data and better test the model

4. You are working on an automated check-out kiosk for a supermarket, and are building a classifier for apples, bananas and oranges. Suppose your classifier obtains a training set error of 0.5%, and dev set error of 7%. Which of the following are promising things to try to improve your classifier?
- [ ] Increase the regularization parameter lambda
- [ ] Decrease the regularization parameter lambda
- [ ] Get more training data
- [ ] Use a bigger neural network

5. Which of the following are regularization techniques
- [ ] Dropout
- [ ] Increase the number of layers on the network
- [ ] Weight decay
- [ ] Gradient Checking

6. Tor reduce high variance, the regularization hyperparameter lambda must be increased. True/False?
- [ ] True
- [ ] False

7. Which of the following are true about dropout?
8. - [ ]
