Substract the mean
$$\begin{align}\mu = \frac{1}{m}\sum^{m}_{i=1}x^{(i)}
\\ x:=x-\mu\end{align}$$
Normalize variance
$$\sigma^{2} = \frac{1}{m}\sum^{m}_{i=}x^{(i)2}$$

Where sigma is a vector with the variance of each of the features $$x = \frac{x}{\sigma}$$
Use the same $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to normalize the training set an test set

For a training set $$
