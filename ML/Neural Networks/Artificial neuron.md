A neuron is the process unit in [[Deep Learning]].
There are two types of operation that a neuron can perform:
- [[Classification]]
- [[Regression]]
The neurons have some specific components:
## Input data of a Neuron
**The input matrix $\vec{X}$ that normally is of $(n_x, m)$ size.**
Where:
$n_x$:  The size of the normally flattened vector of each sample
$m$ : The number of samples

## Labels
The expected output $\vec{y}$ if size $(1, m)$

## Different sets of data
The data must be splitted in two or three sets:
- [[Training set]]
- [[Test set]]
- [[Cross-functional set]]
