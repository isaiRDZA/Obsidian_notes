When starting a deep learning project you will have two types of metrics.
- The ones that you need to optimize: This mean, that these metrics need to be as good as possible. For example the accuracy of a model.
- The ones that you have to satisfy: This metrics normally are constrains of model size (in memory), performance requirements, like time response. This metrics can be just satisfied to its permissive limit. But we donÂ´t need to optimize them.

Normally this two metrics are the ones under your algorithm is going to be evaluated.
