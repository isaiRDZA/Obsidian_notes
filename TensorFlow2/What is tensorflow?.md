Tensorflow uses symbolic mathematics (instead of purely numerical computations), which enables it to perform operations like:
- Automatic differentiation on a computational graph such as a neural network. 
- Another major benefit is its ability to perform computations on GPU hardware, potentially leading to large speedups. 

- [[Keras API]]
